  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Łatwa Forma | Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
  <p>The data controller is VENTAS NORBERT WRÓBLEWSKI, ul. Szczytowa 27/10, 41-608 Świętochłowice, Poland. Contact: contact@latwaforma.pl.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>Łatwa Forma collects and processes data necessary for the app to function, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>account data (email, user ID), including when signing in with Google – email and identifier from your Google account,</li>
    <li>profile data (age, gender, weight, height, activity level),</li>
    <li>meal entries, activity logs, and water intake records,</li>
    <li>when using integrations – access tokens for Strava and Garmin Connect, and imported activities,</li>
    <li>for Premium subscription – user identifier passed to Stripe to link payments to your account (we do not store card/BLIK data; Stripe processes it),</li>
    <li>for push notifications (water, meal reminders) – device identifier for delivery via iOS/Android.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Purpose of Processing</h2>
  <p>Data is used solely to provide the service: tracking calorie balance, nutrition, and physical activity, processing payments (Stripe), and sending notifications if you enable them.</p>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (Art. 6 GDPR)</h2>
  <p>We process personal data on the following bases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> – account data, profile data, meals, activities, water, integrations, and data necessary for Premium subscription, to provide the service under the terms of use.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> – push notifications (water, meal reminders) if you enable them; you can disable them in your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> – where necessary to assert or defend against claims, and to respond to your enquiries (e.g. contact@latwaforma.pl).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Google Sign-In and Payments (Stripe)</h2>
  <p>Sign-in with Google is subject to Google's policies; we only use email and identifier to provide the service. Premium payments are processed by Stripe – we pass your user identifier to link the payment to your account. Card, BLIK, or PayPal data is processed by Stripe; we do not store it. See <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>6. Integrations (Strava, Garmin)</h2>
  <p>If you connect your Strava or Garmin Connect account, we import only the activities you have authorized. We do not share or sell this data to third parties. You can disconnect the integration at any time in the app settings.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Data is stored on Supabase servers (Europe). Integrated data (Strava, Garmin) is retained only as needed for synchronization.</p>
  <p><strong>Retention:</strong> Account-related data is kept until you delete your account (Profile → Delete account). After deletion, data is removed within the timeframe of our technical procedures (typically within 30 days). Data required for accounting (e.g. invoices, payment records) is kept for the period required by law (in Poland, including 5 years from the end of the tax year). Backup data may be deleted with some delay in line with our hosting policy.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to access (Art. 15 GDPR), rectification (Art. 16), erasure – “right to be forgotten” (Art. 17), restriction of processing (Art. 18), data portability (Art. 20 – on request we can provide your data in a format that allows transfer to another provider), and to object to processing (Art. 21). Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw it at any time without affecting the lawfulness of earlier processing.</p>
  <p>You can delete your account and associated data in the app (Profile → Delete account). For other rights, contact us at contact@latwaforma.pl.</p>
  <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority – in Poland: President of the Personal Data Protection Office (ul. Stawki 2, 00-193 Warsaw), <a href="https://uodo.gov.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uodo.gov.pl</a>.</p>

  <h2>9. Cookies</h2>
  <p>This website does not use cookies for user tracking. If we use cookies necessary for the app to function (e.g. session), this will be stated in this policy.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes</h2>
  <p>Updates to this policy will be published on this page. By continuing to use the app after changes, you accept the updated policy.</p>
