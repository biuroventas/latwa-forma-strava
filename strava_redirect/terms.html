  <h1>Terms of Use – Łatwa Forma</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <h2>1. General</h2>
  <p>These Terms govern your use of the “Łatwa Forma” mobile app and related services (the App). The provider is VENTAS NORBERT WRÓBLEWSKI, ul. Szczytowa 27/10, 41-608 Świętochłowice, Poland (email: contact@latwaforma.pl). By using the App, you accept these Terms.</p>

  <h2>2. Service</h2>
  <p>The App is for tracking calories, macros, physical activity, weight, and hydration. Some features are free; Premium features (e.g. unlimited AI advice, PDF export, full integrations) require a subscription or one-time Premium purchase.</p>

  <h2>3. Account and data</h2>
  <p>You may create an account (Google or email sign-in) to save data. You are responsible for keeping your credentials secure. Personal data processing is described in the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>4. Premium subscription and payments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Monthly or yearly subscription and a one-time yearly Premium option – current prices (in PLN) are shown in the App before purchase.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments</strong> are processed by Stripe (card, BLIK, PayPal, etc.). Stripe’s terms and privacy policy apply to payment processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time in the App (Profile → Łatwa Forma Premium → Cancel subscription). Premium access continues until the end of the paid period. No refund for the unused period unless required by consumer law.</li>
    <li><strong>Trial:</strong> A one-time trial (e.g. 24 hours) may be offered on terms shown in the App. After the trial, without purchasing Premium, access to Premium features ends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Withdrawal (consumers)</h2>
  <p>If you are a consumer under EU law, you have the right to withdraw from the contract within 14 days of its conclusion without giving a reason. To do so, contact us at contact@latwaforma.pl. For digital services (e.g. Premium), if you have expressly requested that performance begin before the 14-day period ends, the right of withdrawal ends once the service has been fully performed.</p>

  <h2>6. Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>You use the App in compliance with the law and in a way that does not harm other users or the provider. Circumventing security, bulk data scraping, or using the App for purposes other than intended is prohibited.</p>

  <h2>7. Ownership and liability</h2>
  <p>The App and its content (interface, logic, branding) are owned by the provider. The service is provided “as is.” The provider is not liable for user decisions based on App content (e.g. dietary advice) or for failures not caused by the provider.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>Changes will be published on this page with the date of update. Material changes (e.g. pricing, scope of service) may also be communicated in the App. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>9. Governing law and disputes</h2>
  <p>Polish law applies to these Terms and to contracts made in connection with the App. Disputes with consumers may be resolved amicably or in court; consumers may also use the ODR platform: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>.</p>
