  <ul>
    <li>account data (email, user ID), including when signing in with Google – email and identifier from your Google account,</li>
    <li>profile data (age, gender, weight, height, activity level),</li>
    <li>meal entries, activity logs, and water intake records,</li>
    <li>when using integrations – access tokens for Strava and Garmin Connect, and imported activities,</li>

    <li>for push notifications (water, meal reminders) – device identifier for delivery via iOS/Android.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Purpose of Processing</h2>
  <p>Data is used solely to provide the service: tracking calorie balance, nutrition, and physical activity, processing payments (Stripe), and sending notifications if you enable them.</p>

  <h2>4. Google Sign-In and Payments (Stripe)</h2>
  <p>Sign-in with Google is subject to Google’s policies; we only use email and identifier to provide the service.

  <h2>6. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Data is stored on Supabase servers (Europe). Integrated data (Strava, Garmin) is retained only as needed for synchronization.</p>
